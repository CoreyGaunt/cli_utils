## What Changes?

- Planted the Arcane Algorithm next to the Energy Tree, drawing power from the lands core.
- Enchanted the Leaves of Logic to gather energy more efficiently from the surrounding Code Canopy.

## How Does This Impact Me/Us?

- Our spells and incantations will now draw from an inexhaustible source, ensuring our magic remains strong and sustainable.
- The Energy Tree will now flourish, providing us with the power to continue our quest.
